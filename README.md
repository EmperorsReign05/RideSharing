## 📋 Project Description

The Decentralized Ride-Sharing Platform is a blockchain-based smart contract built on the Stacks network using Clarity. This project eliminates intermediaries in ride-sharing by providing a trustless, transparent platform where passengers and drivers can interact directly. The contract handles escrow payments automatically, ensuring both parties are protected during transactions.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Escrow System**: Passenger funds are held in the contract until ride completion
- **Transparent Operations**: All ride requests and completions are recorded on-chain
- **Direct P2P Interaction**: No centralized authority controlling transactions
- **Automated Payments**: Smart contract releases payment upon ride completion


---

## 🎯 Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the ride-sharing industry by creating a decentralized ecosystem that:

- **🔓 Empowers Users**: Gives control back to passengers and drivers by removing centralized platforms
- **💰 Reduces Costs**: Eliminates platform fees and intermediary charges
- **🔍 Ensures Transparency**: All transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **🤝 Builds Trust**: Smart contract automation ensures fair and secure transactions
- **🚀 Promotes Innovation**: Provides a foundation for community-driven ride-sharing solutions

We envision a future where transportation services operate on decentralized protocols, fostering innovation, reducing costs, and creating more equitable opportunities for all participants in the sharing economy.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation


The smart contract consists of two core functions:

1. **`request-ride`**: Allows passengers to request rides and escrow payment
2. **`complete-ride`**: Enables passengers to complete rides and trigger driver payment

The contract uses STX (Stacks native token) for payments and maintains ride state through blockchain storage.

### Contract Functions Overview

```clarity
;; Main Functions
(define-public (request-ride (driver principal) (fare uint)))
(define-public (complete-ride (ride-id uint)))

;; Read-only Functions
(define-read-only (get-ride-info (ride-id uint)))
(define-read-only (get-next-ride-id))
```
